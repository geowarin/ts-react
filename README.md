Typescript, react and webpack hot reload

## Launching the application

    npm install
    npm start

## Editing

Use atom with the awesome [Typescript plugin](https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript).
Your changes will be automatically picked up by [React Hot Loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader) and
will be displayed without reloading.

## Why Typescript?

Typescript [recently added](http://www.jbrantly.com/typescript-and-jsx) support for jsx.

It is a very interesting language.
It gives you autocompletion, all sorts of refactoring and compile time errors (for react components props for examples!).

Give it a shot, it might change the way you develop :)
